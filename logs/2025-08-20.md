## What did I work on today?
- Today i worked on my Maui Banking assignment, for the multiplatform software develpoment course Im in. I added a file that pulled the SQLite Database that was already set up as part of the template. 

## What did I learn?
- How to successfully link a remote repository to my repository on github via the terminal using git commands. 
- How to commit and push changes successfully to my repo on githb by using the terminal also using git commands. #smallWins
- that there is SQLite nget package as part of the template.

## Any blockers?
- While working on assignment on my personal laptop, on VS, i wanted to add a .xaml file to my Views folder for the UI of CustomerSelectionPage, but after clicking on the "Add" option to add the xaml file, it did not appear. What did appear was an .xml file. I tried it but it was not the same as a .xaml file. I don't know what the issue may be but i'll sort it out tomorrow.
