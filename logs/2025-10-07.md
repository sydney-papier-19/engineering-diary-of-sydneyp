## What did I work on today?
- I worked on the Hidden Sugars Scanner Page for the app my team and I are developing for our final project.
- In class we created different resource groups in Azure and connected them to different AI services such as camera vision and speech services.

## What did I learn?
- Learnt a lot about different controls in .net maui such as frame vs border, border uses a term called Stroke which refers to the colour, StrokeShape for a round or rectangle shape and Shadow for shadow of the box. It difers slightly from Frame, the terms are just different.
- I learnt how to creat a resource group.
- I learnt more about how computer vision and speech services operate.
- the past weekend, I learnt more about routing and navigation when i got an error in my  Views.HiddenSugarsScannerPage.xaml. I learnt that i had to connect it to my MauiProgram.cs using "builder.Services.AddTransient<Views.HiddenSugarsPage>();" and link it in my AppShell.xaml by adding the namespace.

## Any blockers?
- For some reason i'm not able to commit my changes that i made after completing my code even though there are no build errors and all the changes are staged.
- sleeeep.
- CodeSpace hackathon, one team member just dropped out. 
- need to finish the reports page next.
